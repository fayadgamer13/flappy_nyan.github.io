* **Controls:** Tap or click anywhere on the screen to make the player (Nyan Cat) jump.
* **Game Over:** You lose if the player falls to the ground or touches any of the pipes.

I am developing **Flappy Nyan** for mobile and it will come out on Android (**December 18, 2025**). For iOS, it will take a lot of time because you need a **MacBook** or **iMac**. Don't worry, I will find a **solution** to that in the future (**late 2026**).

* iOS: iOS **10** or above (such as iOS 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 26).

**How to Check**
* Android: Open **Settings** > **About Phone** or **About Tablet** > **Android Version** (if you tap Android Version times it shows an Android easter **egg**).
* Android(Samsung One UI): Open **Settings** > **About Phone** or **About Tablet** > **Software information** > Android Version(if you tap Android Version times it shows an Android easter **egg**).
